In this tutorial, we will learn about the latest trends in Image Super-Resolution as we draw a contrast between the humble beginnings of this field and what the latest state-of-the-art techniques are bringing out as results. Specifically, we’ll go over the following topics:

- Why super-resolution is an important yet underlooked side of computer vision
- Classical algorithms
- Current state-of-the-art techniques
- Applications in the real world
- The way forward
