This documents my journey of working with Keras.io and its open-source repository of code examples and tutorials.

# Introduction

I began my open-source journey largely by contributing to Keras.io and the adjoining libraries within the Keras Ecosystem. Listed below are some of my contributions till date. If youâ€™re looking to make a contribution of your own or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out via email to discuss the same.

# Official Examples

Below is a list of the code examples I have written, that are live on keras.io now.

## [When Recurrence meets Transformers](https://keras.io/examples/vision/temporal_latent_bottleneck)

This example, in joint work with [Aritra Roy Gosthipaty](https://arig23498.github.io/), was done to implement a novel research paper known as [Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14794). We implemented this with no references except for the paper, since no code was released by the authors. This was also subsequently the first TensorFlow/Keras implementation of the paper at the time.

## [Using the Forward-Forward Algorithm for Image Classification](https://keras.io/examples/vision/forwardforward)

This example was one very close to me, as I wrote it as a pastime experiment while playing around with a new paper released by [Prof. Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) that detailed a technique for performing optimization without any backpropagation, but by instead performing 2 specialized forward-passes. This was a challenge to implement at first due to the inherent design of almost all Deep Learning frameworks to support backpropagation natively, but I created a workaround to make an acceptable implementation at the time. This was (arguably) the first TensorFlow/Keras implementation of this algorithm.

## [Image Segmentation using Composable Fully-Convolutional Networks](https://keras.io/examples/vision/fully_convolutional_network/)

This example details how to make use of Fully-Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation. It details the implementations of the FCN-32S, FCN-16S, and FCN-8S models and their performance on a certain dataset.

## [Electroencephalogram Signal Classification for action identification](https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/eeg_signal_classification/)

This was my first example ever, that I wrote to get started with contributing to Keras.io as a side-project. It details the use of [Conv1D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution1d/) layers to perform action identification from simple EEG scans of subjects. There are better solutions that exist now for doing this, but this example stays on as a baseline for what can be done and how an initial end-to-end pipeline would look like.
