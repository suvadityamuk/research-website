A set of blogs I wrote for PyImageSearch, a reputed Computer-Vision and Deep-Learning educational technology company.

# Introduction

I began writing for PyImageSearch recently through their External Authors program, which I am a proud member of. I enjoy writing for them due to their commitment to high-quality posts and detailed walkthroughs, which are normally rare to find. Co-incidentally, I made use of this website myself more times than I can count, while I was beginning my journey into Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I was invited to do this by [Aritra Roy Gosthipaty](https://arig23498.github.io/) to whom I remain indebted.

# Blog Posts

These blog posts are citable. Head over to the [Publication](/publications) section to learn more.

## [Getting Started with Docker for Machine Learning](https://pyimagesearch.com/2023/09/04/getting-started-with-docker-for-machine-learning/)

This was the first part in a 3-part series which covered all the basics and essentials a Machine Learning Engineer would need to get started with Docker. It mainly introduced the concept of Containerization and the installation process of Docker

## [Getting Used to Docker for Machine Learning](https://pyimagesearch.com/2023/10/09/getting-used-to-docker-for-machine-learning/)

This was the second part of the 3-part series. It introduced the most common Docker commands, how they work, and their nuances towards using them in a containerized system.

## [Setting Up a GPU Development Environment Using Docker](https://pyimagesearch.com/2023/10/16/setting-up-a-gpu-development-environment-using-docker/)

This was the final part of the 3-part series. It took up an end-to-end use-case of deploying a GPU-enabled NVIDIA PyTorch container for use on Google Cloud Platform from scratch and making use of it through a Jupyter Notebook instance.

## [Unlocking Image Clarity: A Comprehensive Guide to Super-Resolution Techniques](https://pyimagesearch.com/2024/04/29/unlocking-image-clarity-a-comprehensive-guide-to-super-resolution-techniques/)

This was the first part of a 2-part series on how one can perform super-resolution using traditional and Deep-Learning based Computer Vision techniques.

## [Sharpen Your Vision: Super-Resolution of CCTV Images Using Hugging Face Diffusers](https://pyimagesearch.com/2024/06/03/sharpen-your-vision-super-resolution-of-cctv-images-using-hugging-face-diffusers/)

This was the final part of the 2-part series on Super-resolution, that included a tutorial on using Diffusers for performing super-resolution on a sample subset of CCTV images as a complete end-to-end example.
